Docker
======
For a novice hacker, its easy to get overwhelmed by the complexities of building and deploying a web app -- especially in a crowded hackathon venue with poor internet access. Maroon started as a way to test server deployments without an internet connection using Docker, but the project quickly grew into a platform for collaborative programming in a cloud-like environment. Maroon allows users to deploy pre-built docker containers and easy server management across many instances.

Docker Features
-------
* Be able to push code to docker running on some else's computer
* Able to access (send/recieve http requests) from docker on someone else's computers

Hackathon Features
-------
* Everything connects to one computer through private network (w/o public internet)
* * Proxy in to the first docker container so all on the same LAN
